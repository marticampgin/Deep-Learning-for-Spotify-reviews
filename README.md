## Deep Learning for Spotify reviews
This is one of the very first projects I have ever done, which is the main reason the code is not split into modules but kept in a Jupyter notebook.
The project comprises Sentiment Analysis of Spotify reviews with Deep learning, utilizing the keras-library. The notebook also includes a modest analysis
of some of the given features (such as means, counts, word clouds, avgs. of different metrics).
